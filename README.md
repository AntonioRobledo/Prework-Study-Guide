# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. This project was built with the intention that it would help keep students going through the boot camp keep all of their notes in a single place in which they could refer back to. This project solves the problem of students having their notes in a variety of places and becoming lost when needing to efficiently look up information that refers back to the prework. While creating this webpage, I have learned that there is a great deal of work that goes behind setting up the UI. THere are many parts at work here that go beyond what the user is able to see, such as the logic in JavaScript that makes the website fun and easily accesible.
